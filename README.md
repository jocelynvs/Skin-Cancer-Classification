# Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning

## Uses Deep Learning (Graph Convolutional Network) combined with Delaunay Triangulation Method to classify types of skin cancer
### Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic
### Steps:
#### 1. Load Libaries & Datasets
The data used in this project is Skin Cancer ISIC. Data was extracted from Kaggle.
#### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Divide data into Training Set and Validation Set
- Data Visualization
- Data Augmentation
#### 3. Delaunay Triangulation Method
- Generates Delaunay points for the data
#### 4. Modeling
Create model using Graph Convolutional Network Algorithm
#### 5. Evaluation 
Evaluate the model based on Accuracy and Loss
#### 6. Classify using Testing Set
- Generate Delaunay points for testing data
- Classify using the best model
